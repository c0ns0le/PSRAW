SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the RedditOAuthDuration Enum

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The `RedditOAuthDuration` enumerator represents the available options for
    Access Token durations during Authorization code requests to the Reddit API.
    The `RedditOAuthDuration` Enumerator is imported automatically when you
    import the PSRAW module.

FIELDS
Permanent
    Requests for permanent OAuth Access Tokens will issue an OAuth Refresh
    Token. Access Tokens are valid for 60 minutes. When the Access Token expires
    the Refresh Token can be used to request a new access token without
    requiring the application to be authorized again. Refresh tokens are valid
    until a user or developer revokes the authorization for the application. When
    `Permanent` Access Tokens are "renewed" the do not require a new grant flow
    and the Refresh Token will be used to request a new Access Token.
    `Permanent` can only be used with `Code` and `Script` methods.

Temporary
    Requests for temporary OAuth Access Tokens will not issue Refresh Tokens and
    when they expire the user will need to authorize the applications again.
    Access Tokens are valid for 60 minutes. When `Temporary` Access Tokens are
    "renewed" a new grant flow is started.
    `Temporary` can be used with any grant flow.

EXAMPLES
Permanent
    Import-Module PSRAW
    $Permanent = [RedditOAuthDuration]::Permanent

Temporary
    Import-Module PSRAW
    $Temporary = [RedditOAuthDuration]::Temporary
