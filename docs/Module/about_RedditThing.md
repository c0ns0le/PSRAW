## about_RedditThing

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes the RedditThing Class (experimental)

# LONG DESCRIPTION
This is a meta-class used for objects returned from the reddit API. "Reddit Things" describe what the returned object is, such as a listing, a comment, a submission, a subreddit, etc.

# Constructors
## RedditThing()
Creates an empty `RedditThing`

```powershell
[RedditThing]::new()
```


## RedditThing(System.Management.Automation.PSObject Object)
Creates a `RedditThing` form a `PSObject` converted from JSON Reddit API response.

```powershell
[RedditThing]::new([System.Management.Automation.PSObject]$Object)
```


# Properties
## Data
The "Thing" being returned such as a listing, a comment, a submission, a subreddit, etc.

```yaml
Name: Data
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject
Hidden: False
Static: False
```


## Id
The ID for the object may also be returned with the Reddit Thing meta-data. For Things without ID's (such as a listing), this will be empty.

```yaml
Name: Id
Type: String
Hidden: False
Static: False
```

## Kind
The `RedditThingKind` that identifies what kind of Reddit Thing this is.

```yaml
Name: Kind
Type: RedditThingKind
Hidden: False
Static: False
```

## Name
The Reddit Name for the object may also be returned with the Reddit Thing meta-data. For Things without Reddit Names (such as a listing), this will be empty.

```yaml
Name: Name
Type: String

Static: False
```


## ParentObject
If A Reddit Thing was a child of something like a listing, the `ParentObject` may contain the parent object.

```yaml
Name: Parent
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject
Hidden: False
Static: False
```


## RedditData
A converted `RedditDataObject` of the `RedditThing`. For example, it the `RedditThing` is a comment, `RedditData` will contain the converted `RedditComment` object.

```yaml

Type: RedditDataObject
Hidden: False
Static: False
```
