SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the RedditMore Class

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Represents a `More` objects returned from teh reddit API. A more is returned
    containing a list of IDs when a listing contains too many items to return
    all of the data for all items. This happens, for example, when a submission
    has too many replies. X number or replies will be returned normally and the
    rest will be returned as a `More`. Another instance when a `More` is
    returned is when a comments is too deep in the reply chain that an empty
    More is returned to indicate the comment has replies that can be fetched
    separately.
